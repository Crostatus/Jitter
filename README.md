 ## Introduction   
 **Disclaimer:** *this program is not for professional use. It has been written only for educational purpose, as an assignment project for the Network Management course at [Unipi](https://di.unipi.it/).*

This is a sniffer example using [libpcap](https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap.3pcap.html) to analyze the communication frequency of TCP streams.    
libpcap is a portable C/C++ library for network traffic capture. ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap))

**What does the jitter measure?** The jitter is defined as the *variation* in the delay (or latency) of received packets.

This program aims to see the jitter of TCP comunications happening from/to the host machine, and detects suspicious jitter variation.

 # Aim of this tool  
 The main purpose of this program is to allow the user to monitor his network traffic.    
 An alarm is sent to the user when a detected connection happens to have a unusual jitter behaviour.    
 Since **an alarm could not represent a malicious activity**, this software can be seen as **a tool to have a first look on what's going on in his network**.    

 It also offers the option to **save, as a graph, the image of a communication** trend about his jitter. Those images will be stored in the *graphs* directory.

## How to build it
In order to compile this project, you need to have [libpcap](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap) (*v 1.9.1-3 or newer*), [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) (*v 5.2 or newer*) and [libnotify](https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/0.7/) (*v 0.7.9-1ubuntu2*) installed.    
One way to easily get it, **on Ubuntu**, is to use the following commands:    
`sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`sudo apt-get install gnuplot`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `sudo apt-get install libnotify-dev`    

**For testing only** &nbsp; [nmap](https://nmap.org/nping/) and [xterm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xterm) are also needed. To get them:    
`sudo apt install nmap` &nbsp;&nbsp; `sudo apt-get install -y xterm`



To check your current versions:    
`apt-cache show libpcap-dev` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;`gnuplot-V`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `apt-cache show libnotify-dev`

That's it! Now you can use the Makefile to get everything done, just run `make` in the project folder and you are ready to go.     

## Program usage
This program, once started, can capture packets *endlessly* or *stop once a default amount has been reached*.
Those two ways to run and which network device to use can be set giving extra parameters at launch. All available parameters are listed below:

|NAME                |TYPE                       |OPTIONAL                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|packet_number|Non negative integer            |yes         |    
|device_name| String            |yes         |

The network device to use can be chosen by adding its name as an additional parameter, writing "**-i** device_name".  
If no "**-i** *device_name*" is provided, the first network device listed by [libpcap's method `pcap_findalldevs()`](https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap_findalldevs.3pcap.html) will be used.

**Otherwise**, if you need help, you can run it with "**-h**" to read a short description on how to launch and what to expect from it.

**Examples**:    
- `sudo ./jitter 50` &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will stop after capturing the next 50 packets.    
- `sudo ./jitter`&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will start sniffing until interrupted.    
- `sudo ./jitter -i wlp2s0`&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will start sniffing from the wlp2s0 interface until interrupted.
- `sudo ./jitter 50 -i wlp2s0` &nbsp; will stop after capturing the next 50 packets from the wlp2s0 interface.  
- `sudo ./jitter -h` &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will show a help description.

**In the first four cases** the sniffing can be correctly stopped sending a **SIGINT** (*Ctlr + c*) interruption to this process.

**It is required** to run this program with `sudo`.

Once that the sniffing has stopped, a very simple menu will show up to see the collected data.   

## How it works
This program aims to detect and notify a **suspicious** jitter variation happening in a **TCP** communication that has been captured since the program is sniffing.    
Each pair of <IP_source, IP_destination> gets treated as a different communication, and it will be prepresented as **IP:IP_source->IP_destination**.    

The programs notes every time a pair of hosts exchanges a stream of TCP packets by looking at the ones having `SYN = 1` ( The **SYN** flag synchronizes sequence numbers to initiate a TCP connection ).    
Every time that one of those packets gets captured, informations about it will be stored, as:    
- Arrive time    
- Delay from previous packet
- Source port
- Destination port
- Jitter of its communication
- Order of arrival

In order to calculate the jitter, since it represents the variance of intra-packet delay, **at least three** TCP streams exchanges need to have happened in a communication.  

### How the jitter gets calculated?  
A communication's jitter gets calculated using the following formula:  
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{200}&space;\bg_white&space;\fn_jvn&space;\LARGE&space;jitter&space;=&space;sum(|x(i)&space;-&space;x(i-1)|)&space;/&space;(n-1))">    

Where:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*x(i)*&nbsp;&nbsp;= arrive time of the i th packet.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*n* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= total packets number at the moment.

### When is a connection suspicious?    
This program defines a behaviour suspicious when a new jitter undergoes **a variation greater than 50% of the average jitter's communication**.    

A minimal example on a <IP_source, IP_destination> exchange of TCP packets:    

|Packet with `SYN = 1`              |Jitter (ms)                       | Average jitter (ms)| Is suspicious         |           
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 th    |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    105    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60                    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*yes*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 th		            |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120     |     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72        |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*yes*
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 th| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115            | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79       |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *no* |
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 th         | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 99 | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82 |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *no*    

In order to get a more accurate jitter average and avoid sending false/premature alarms when the connection is just starting, the program will start to decide to notify a jitter variation to the user **from the 5 th packet on**.    

# Testing
The Makefile is provided with a **test** option, but in order to correcly run it, you have to install two more things: [nmap](https://nmap.org/nping/) and [xterm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xterm).
To install them,**on Ubuntu**, just type in your terminal:    
`sudo apt install nmap` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `sudo apt-get install -y xterm`    

Nmap is a open source tool for packet network generation.    
xterm is a unix-like terminal emulator.

**Type `make test` to start the test**.    
It consists in starting various TCP communications to generate some network traffic meanwhile this tool is running, to let the sniffing start.
